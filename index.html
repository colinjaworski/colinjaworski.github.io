    <div class="overview">
   
      <p>I've been working as an arborist for the last ten years doing general tree care, training new staff on safe climbing techniques, as well as, managing crews. I love to stay active outside of work by running and riding bikes. Recently I have started to create my own bicycle frames, which is really exciting. I live in Oakdale with my beautiful wife and three dogs.   </p>
